TODO

1. Research all the addressing mode:
Immediate	

Zero Page	

Zero Page,X	

Absolute	

Absolute,X	

Absolute,Y	

(Indirect,X)	

(Indirect),Y

We need to know this to figure out the difference in parameters with each opcode, and what they should be doing.

2. Research how memory works in the 6502 (like the zero page, and how programs are written for this)

3. Reading up on registers.

4. Look into how easy it is to implement own data-type.

5. Leave ALU for later.
